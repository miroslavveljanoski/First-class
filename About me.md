I'm Miroslav but you can call me _Miki_. I'm coming from **North Macedonia**. I moved to **Belgium** at the beginning of February this year. Currently I live in Aalst. 

I have a bachelor's degree in Economics. My last job in Macedonia was as a Quality manager for ISO quality management standards. I also have experience as a logistic coordinator for international transport.

I want to make a change in my career and learn _web development_. I just started with learning with [Hack Your Future](https://hackyourfuture.be/), coding school in **Belgium**.
